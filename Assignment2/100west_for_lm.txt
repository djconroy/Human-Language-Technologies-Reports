north of fifty three
a magic phrase
spoken mumbled or thought inwardly by thousands of souls venturing northward
an imaginary line shown only on maps and labelled fifty three degrees
its presence indicated to highway travellers by road side signs
a division of territory as distinct in the mind as any international border
if you have not been north of fifty three you have not been north
travellers and writers poets and pilots have contributed to the lore of the north
the rigors of life in the bush are told in tales of man eating mosquitoes of murderous hordes of black flies of the lumps of flesh carried away by the giant bull dog flies
the stories of record breaking trout walleye and pike are legion
there are tales of sights and sounds heard deep in the spruce forests
the crashing of moose tearing through brush and breaking down trees
the drumming of grouse
the incessant hum of insects
the cackling quackery of ducks feeding on quiet ponds and placid bays
once heard the intermittent song of the loon is never forgotten
its voice the signature of authenticity of a northern scene
if the wildlife in the northern bush land seems different than found elsewhere so is the life of man
it takes a special breed of person to live in the north
the farther one travels the more this becomes apparent
the southerner whether on his first or fiftieth trip north of fifty three never really becomes aware of the implications of northern living
generally the owners of cottages on southern lakes have more amenities at hand for a weekend of roughing it than most northern dwellers have on a year round basis
the modern cabin on a lake shore near a large metropolitan center is equipped with electric service a telephone paved roads natural gas pipelines and cable television
nearby are services that provide food fuel repairs and entertainment
drivein theaters and fast food chains abound
waterfront businesses have docks built for those arriving by boat to do their shopping laundry or to transfer suitcases from the family car
the local merchants deliver goods to the cabin by road or by water
entrepreneurs make a businesss of servicing and maintaining cabins during the owners absence in the off seasons
most of these cottages whether on the lake shore or located five well paved streets from the water rival the homes of many city dwellers
these lake side communities although seasonal differ little from the urban living from which they offer escape
look at an average northern community
study and compare the standards with those of urban areas and their nearby lake side retreats
there are no local bus services
if the car doesnt start you either walk or call a taxi
yes most areas do have a taxi service of one kind or another
even if its a ride in the back of some ones pick up truck
mail delivery is unknown
a pleasant stroll in midsummer is contrasted by an ordeal in life threatening conditions during winter
house to house delivery of milk and bread is nonexistent
perhaps newspapers are delivered but it requires a family effort especially in winter
bus rail and scheduled air services to nearby settlements is severely restricted if available at all
many small taxi companies exist because of the large fares collected in the transport of natives to and from the reserves
although diminishing in recent years the bushpilot and charter aircraft still play a large role in northern transportation
the pilots of these small aircraft learn to live with conditions that would keep their southern colleagues on the ground
in summer they fly float equipped aircraft
they are busy hauling trappers fishermen freight fish furs and supplies to and from the reserves fish camps traplines logging areas and small settlements
in the fall when the ice is too thin for skis yet too thick for floats they change the aircraft to wheel equipment
changing to skis when ice conditions permit
winter flying presents problems that most pilots never hear of
temperatures exceeding forty below zero blowing snow ice crystals and whiteouts
all these challenge the pilot in their daily work
the preheating of engines to coax them to life
the problem of congealed oil in propeller pitch mechanisms and fueling with super cooled gasoline are regular chores
the skiequipped aircraft must be tied down with ropes that are frozen into holes in the four foot ice
the skis must be lifted or run onto boards or poles to prevent them freezing into the ice
pilots and passengers must wear heavy arctic clothing as few aircraft have cabin heat systems capable of coping with the cold
aircraft batteries are removed at the end of each day of flying to ensure maximum efficiency the next day
wings and engines are covered to stop the ingress of snow and the build up of frost on the flight surfaces
gasoline fueled blowpots are often carried to provide engine preheat to ensure starting
the oil in these engines gets so thick at minus forty to fifty degrees that the engine cannot be turned
this writer has done chinups on the propeller of a coldsoaked cessna which flew the next day after preheating
the northern airports lack any degree of services in comparison to those farther south
fuel is usually available if you can locate the operator
some of the larger communities may have a pay telephone at the airstrip but the normal procedure is to buzz the town on arrival
this lets the people know you are landing and usually someone will head out to the strip to meet you
unless you are a regular customer all transactions for fuel and oil are on a cash basis
cheques are nearly useless in a village without a bank
credit to a stranger is foolhardy
during the grip of winter the snowmobile is the major mode of transport in all but the largest of settlements
in many places that do have roads in winter vehicles are left running twenty four hours a day
if allowed to get cold it may take many hours of effort to restart balky engines
most northern residents enjoy the winter months
the change  in seasons brings on a change in activities
the boats and motors are stored away with the lawnmowers and garden chairs
the snowmobiles are tuned up icefishing shacks are towed onto lakes and rivers
the blades of gaspowered ice augers are sharpened
the fishermen flock to their favorite spots and drill holes through ice up to four feet thick
whether in the comfort of a shack with a woodburning stove glowing in the center or huddled on the ice in the lee of a snowmobile they normally take a good catch
walleye trout pike tullibee and whitefish as well as perch burbot catfish and bass are plentiful
the most popular bait is minnows some use suckerbelly or net bags of trout eggs
others use metal spoons or large bucktail flies leadheaded jigging lures or just snelled hooks
as in summer the best bait is whatever the fish are taking at the time
moose hunting is another favorite sport especially in the colder weather when the moose are on the move for food and warmth
the hunter faces problems similar to the pilot with his equipment
the extreme temperatures require that his snowmachine be kept in top condition if it is to start after a day of hunting
once started it must be dependable
a life and death situation could develop if the machine breaks down while forty or fifty miles from home
even his rifle requires special care
a bolt covered with heavy grease will freeze solid in the cold
the firing pin may not move when struck by the hammer
many a moose and bear lived to face another day because a hunters weapon failed to operate
other outdoor activities include cross country skiing snowmobiling and racing dog teams
these sports are included in the many winter festivals held each year
as spring arrives the winter equipment is stored away and once again the boats and motors are brought out
wagers are made on the time and date of the break up of river ice
the snow blowers shovels and skidoo suits are replaced with lawn mowers rakes and bathing suits
the pussy willows blossom
the ducks and geese return from their winter feeding grounds in the southern usa
the frogs begin to croak and the first battalions of mosquitoes are hatched
from the winter lows of forty below zero the mercury climbs upward
the summer highs reach the nineties sometimes one hundred degrees
a fantastic differential of one hundred and forty degrees between seasons
through the seasons day to day life continues
the sport and commercial fishing the trapping and hunting
the road building home construction and landscaping
the pilots fly passengers and freight
they fly patrols on hundreds of miles of hydroelectric transmission lines and forest fire patrols
at regular intervals they carry conservationists doing animal census
they transport tanks of baby fish to restock the lakes
the seriously ill or injured are taken to medical centers by medevac flights
other flights carry fishermen and tourists
prospectors vie with geologists botanists biologists entomologists and surveyors
all use the aircraft to see touch smell measure and record the wonders of the north
the opening day of each hunting or fishing season is heralded by the arrival of recreational vehicles of all types
trailers and vans motorhomes and four by fours arrive daily
they carry or tow boats and motors bicycles motorcycles and atvs
the firsttimers fill the private and provincial government campgrounds
the more experienced and adventuresome travel logging roads and bush trails to favorite lakes rivers and streams
in town the streets and parking lots are crammed with vehicles and equipment
gasoline food booze and fishing equipment are sold in great quantities
the hotels are full
reservations were made months in advance some were made prior to leaving the year before
for a few short weeks during the prime spring fishing period every available camping spot is occupied
as the summer wears on the sportsmen recede and tourists take their place
the cycle repeats annually
each year a number of travellers arrive in privately owned aircraft
piper cub to beechcraft
taildragger to bizjet
most have been here before to some it is a new experience
to a southern pilot a trip north can be unnerving
accustomed to flying over a network of roads and railroad tracks always in contact with an airport or navigation aid they are seldom prepared for the realities of northern flight
airports are hundreds of miles apart
in most cases there are no roads or railways for navigation
at lower altitudes voice contact with an airport is an exception rather than the rule
flight plans of course are mandatory
map reading is difficult
there are so many lakes many of them the same basic shape that a sharp eye must be kept on the map
for seaplanes the ever present danger of logs rocks and reefs is amplified by the distance from civilization
flights must be carefully planned around suitable refueling facilities
the pilot of a private seaplane is in his own element here
the pleasure of landing on a remote lake its quiet green waters undisturbed by others is indescribable
after securing the aircraft and setting up camp the true beauty of the north can be enjoyed
waters teeming with fish are surrounded by wildlife of all types
the smells of wood smoke and coffee mingling with the sound of fresh fish sizzling in the frypan
the songs of bird life
the cry of the loon
the evening wail of coyotes and wolves
the whistle of wings as ducks geese ravens hawks and eagles travel down the shoreline
on the lakes are the wakes of passing beaver and muskrat
the occasional warning smack of a beavers tail on the water as he senses danger
the varied hues of trees evergreen and deciduous
the colors of windflowers
the taste of fresh wild strawberries raspberries and blueberries
the excitement of an evening sky dancing with a dazzling display as the aurora borealis appears
the northern lights are surrounded by stars incredibly brilliant against the black smog free heavens
thoughts in the night
lying in your tent you hear rustling noises
a twig snaps
mouse or rabbit
moose or bear
is the food secure
you visualize the food bundle securely tied to a tree branch high above the ground
the wind is rising you can hear small waves breaking on the shore
is the airplane alright
should you go and check it
what will the fishing be like in the morning
will you get another chance to land the big walleye that you lost to day
or a bigger one
a lone mosquito buzzes your ear
somehow he has penetrated the netting of your tent
the cry of a loon is the last thing you hear
you sleep peacefully until the songs of early morning bird life announce the start of a new day
but for the constant buzzstingslap of insect warfare you might be in heaven
far to the south your friends and neighbors are also facing a new day
howling dogs
screaming kids
squealing tires
the wail of police and fire sirens
the reek of diesel fumes from passing trucks and busses
telephones jangle and typewriters clatter
the work piles up
dissatisfied customers grumble
the boss looms threateningly
they jostle in line for a bus then for coffee then for lunch
they fight traffic to get home
the neighbors dog has left a deposit on the lawn
the childrens toys are cluttering the driveway
they sit down to a tv dinner and discuss your crazy fishing trip
the day to day life in the north does have its problems if you happen to own a car for which there is no local dealer you may have to order parts from hundreds of miles away and have them shipped in by bus or plane
meanwhile the car sits
the same applies to appliances tools and so on
there may not be a tv repairman in town
you must send the set out for repairs or buy a new one
by mail order of course
providing your community has a tv station to begin with
most northern communities have only one radio station
the cbc
some are augmented by local programming
other services may be difficult to obtain
for example a veterinarian may visit weekly or monthly or not at all
medical facilities are usually present to some extent but any serious illness or injury may require a medevac flight to a distant city
fresh meat and produce become more of a problem in the more remote areas
if road or rail service exists the problem is not too acute
however in many communities the only access is by air
in this event the shipment of perishable commodities is dependant on space available on the aircraft
the subsequent prices reflect the added cost of the product
on the subject of costs heating a home with propane may be five to seven times the cost of natural gas as in southern homes
food gasoline clothing and appliances are considerably more expensive in the north
of course the more remote the location the higher the price
on a trip into the high arctic a few years ago the prices ran like this
hotel bed one hundred dollars per night per man
breakfast 2 eggs 2 toast 2 bacon and 2 coffee twelve dollars
avgas seven dollars per gallon
but then when you are two hundred and fifty miles north of the arctic circle you expect to pay higher prices
why then do people live in the north
for the natives it is a matter of ancestry
for many whites it is also ancestry
to some they were born there
their parents having moved north for employment reasons
some are transients following construction jobs and other seasonal employment
others working for large corporations or government are transferred north as a job requirement
life in the north is definitely different
a person accustomed to life in a large city may  not endure the rigors involved
they give it up and move south
many people such as myself move north for an extended period
in our case it was ten years
we adapted to the way of life
we enjoyed the hunting and fishing
owning our own aircraft we were able to travel more independently than our neighbors
we enjoyed all the great outdoors had to offer
we learned to adjust to the lack of night life and other amenities
when ten years had passed and our children were adults we took stock of our situation
we were stuck in a rut
the same rut that most of the townspeople were in
our lives centered around hunting fishing the post office and the tv set
we decided it was a case of moving now or possibly remaining in the north for the rest of our lives
we left in february of nineteen eighty four
we miss the delicious fresh fish from cold clear lakes
we miss the taste of thick moose steaks moosemeat sausages fresh smoked lake trout and pancakes with fresh wild blueberries
we miss the freedom afforded by a short flight to a secluded lake shore
the fishing and hunting within ten miles of our northern home was superb
the friendship and camaraderie of our neighbors was great
we are happy to have had the opportunity to experience northern life
but as we approached the midpoint of our lives we wanted to return to civilization
to pick up where we had left off
to enjoy the supermarkets and shopping malls the fancy restaurants and gourmet foods
we wanted to be closer to the center of things a few hours drive from a major city rather than an all day trip
we returned to old friends and new neighbors
new stores and home mail delivery
lower prices
broader choices
more to do and see
more tv channels
several radio stations and newspapers
we can drive east or west besides north and south
we can dance to live music and eat in restaurants of many nationalities
in short we are back to civilization
